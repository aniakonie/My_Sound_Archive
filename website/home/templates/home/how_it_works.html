<h1 style="text-align: center;">How this app works</h1>
<br>
As a default VML retrieves from your Spotify account all tracks which are:<br>
- your liked songs (all songs included in your “Liked Songs” playlist),<br>
- members of playlists which you have created.<br>
<br>
If some of your liked songs show up in your playlists as well, don't worry - VML takes care of this and won't show any songs in your library duplicated.
You can customize your retrieving algorithm later - exclude songs from all or some of your playlists, include songs from playlists that you follow or all songs from saved albums.
<br><br>
<span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline">VML won't modify any of your data on Spotify</span> - there's simply no functionality in our app which could do that.
You can change the contents of VML library only by adding new songs on Spotify.

<h3 style="text-align: center;">Why VML provides a better way of displaying music library than Spotify?</h3>
<br>
<p>Spotify is renowned for its highly effective music recommendation algorithm, yet the user's library lacks methods
    for organizing its content. While it's easy to discover new music to add to your collection, it becomes increasingly
    challenging to keep track of it.</p>

<p>Unless you search through a long list of liked songs or artists when selecting something to listen to there's
a risk of missing a significant portion of your content. While it's possible to organize songs into playlists,
adding them all to playlists isn't a practical solution. Playlists can be organized into folders but unfortunately
this feature is not extended to artists whom the user follows.</p>
